# InstaHeat -- pseudo-spectral preheating code with gravitational instabilities

A pseudo-spectral code to evolve a single scalar field in the FLRW metric
including scalar perturbations and backreactions through a phase of metric
preheating after the end of chaotic large field inflation. The produced tensor
perturbations are used to compute the generated gravitational wave spectrum.
